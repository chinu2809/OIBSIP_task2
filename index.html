              <font color="#8B000">Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his
                family in
                the temple city of
                Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque. At
                the
                same time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family,
                from
                which he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and
                property tracts. But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge
                losses
                due to the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's family had become inadequate and struggled hard
                to
                make a living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income. </font>

                            convinced by his choice of a job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where
